In galaxy X1X, in 2163.

The new space government seeks to destroy enemy planets. It's a tough fight, but luckily you're here to help, Captain.

## üîë prerequisites

if you have a *Windows machine*, you'll need to install Visual Studio, CMake and CPack.

*More about Visual Studio => https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/*

*More about CMake => https://cmake.org/download/*

*More about NSIS (Cpack) => https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download*

## üíª Usage

* __Linux__ ~
Simply run the bash script *build.sh*:
```bash
./build.sh
```

* __Windows__ ~ (on powershell):
```powershell
.\build.bat
```

This will generate 2 binaries:

On linux:
* `./rtype_server` 
* `./rtype_client`

On Windows:
* `.\rtype_server.exe` 
* `.\rtype_client.exe`

### Server

```bash
./rtype_server [PORT]
```

the arguments is:
* __[ PORT ]__ for the port to be connected to

### Client

```bash
./rtype_client [PORT] [HOST]
```

the arguments are:
* __[ PORT ]__ for the port to be connected to
* __[ HOST ]__ for the machine's domain name

## üìù Architecture

Our project is composed by 3 parts:
* Game Engine
* Client
* Server

### Game Engine
